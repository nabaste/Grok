# Grok
Grok is an interactive VR experience about different perspectives & mental conditions such as ADHD, Schizophrenia, & Autism to bring about equity & inclusivity.
Focusing on ADHD, Grok has a series of events & interactions that generate awareness & empathy amongst caretakers, friends, & family. Alongside being a platform for researchers & students to understand the situation & condition thoroughly.

## How it works:

#Step 1: 
Grok's Safe Home Environment
User enters Grok's calming home ambiance to pick an experience from options like ADHD, Autism & Schizophrenia, reading descriptions, viewing duration & intensity, or simply entering a safe space.


#Step 2: 
Launching the Experience
User explores the persona (Alex) & storyline in detail & begins the experience (ADHD). A disclaimer & trigger warning with information on voice commands prompts up alongside a voice-based preview.

#Step 3: 
Falling into Alex’s head
Using passthrough, voice commands & game-based interactions, User follows a narrative of Alex's daily life, struggling with symptoms of the mental condition that makes simple tasks challenging.


#Step 4: 
Aligning with Alex’s thoughts
User is mentally tested by game-based interactions, experiencing impactful & chaotic events. Information on using passthrough & voice commands to interact with or exit to home if preferred prompts up.

#Step 5: 
The Beginning of Empathy
A Call-to-Action placard evokes a final empathetic response from the User, driving them to relive the experience or end it if preferred, heading back to their home environment for more options.
